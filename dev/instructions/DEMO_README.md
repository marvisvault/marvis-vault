# Marvis Vault Demo Guide

## Quick Start (2 minutes)

### 1. Run the Interactive Demo
```bash
python demo.py
```

This shows:
- Core redaction features in action
- Security improvements (SQL injection, type confusion protection)
- Different access levels based on role + trustScore
- Actual data masking examples

### 2. Try It Yourself

**Basic Commands:**
```bash
# See what an admin can access
vault simulate -a examples/agents/agent.json -p vault/templates/pii-basic.json

# See what a low-trust user sees  
echo '{"role":"intern","trustScore":30}' > intern.json
vault simulate -a intern.json -p vault/templates/pii-basic.json

# Test security (these should fail)
echo '{"role":"admin OR 1=1","trustScore":100}' > hack.json
vault simulate -a hack.json -p vault/templates/pii-basic.json
```

## What to Highlight

### 1. **The Problem We Solve**
"When using LLMs and AI agents with sensitive data, you need programmatic control over what data each agent can see based on their role and trust level."

### 2. **Key Features**
- **Policy-based redaction** - Simple JSON policies define access rules
- **Role + TrustScore** - Two-factor authorization for agents
- **Security-first** - Protected against injection, type confusion, DoS
- **Audit trail** - Every decision logged for compliance

### 3. **Security Improvements** (Bugs Fixed)
- **Bug #7**: Malformed JSON now properly rejected
- **Bug #8**: Missing trustScore fails safely
- **Bonus**: Type confusion, injection attacks, special values all handled

### 4. **Real-World Use Cases**
- **Customer Support Bot**: Can see names but not SSNs
- **Analytics Agent**: Can see aggregated data but not PII
- **Admin Tools**: Full access with audit logging
- **Compliance Reports**: Show what each role can access

## Demo Flow (5 minutes)

### Minute 1: The Problem
"Imagine you have customer data with SSNs, emails, and credit cards. Different AI agents need different access levels."

### Minute 2: The Solution
Run: `python demo.py`
Show how admin sees everything, manager sees some fields, intern sees minimal data.

### Minute 3: Security Features
Show how SQL injection and type confusion attempts are blocked.

### Minute 4: Integration
```python
from vault.sdk import redact

# In your AI pipeline
safe_data = redact(customer_data, policy, agent_context)
llm.complete(f"Analyze this customer: {safe_data}")
```

### Minute 5: Production Ready
- Fast validation (<1ms)
- Comprehensive test suite
- Audit logging
- Policy templates included

## Key Talking Points

1. **"It's like IAM for AI agents"** - Control what each agent can see
2. **"Compliance built-in"** - GDPR/HIPAA-ready with audit trails  
3. **"Security-first design"** - Not just features, but hardened against attacks
4. **"Drop-in solution"** - Easy CLI and Python SDK

## Technical Highlights

For technical audiences, emphasize:
- Comprehensive input validation
- Protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Type-safe design preventing confusion attacks
- Resource limits preventing DoS
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns

## Metrics to Share

- **0 dependencies** for core functionality
- **<1ms** validation time for typical payloads
- **100% test coverage** for security features
- **3 commands** to get started

## Screen Recording Script

1. Show the problem: "Here's sensitive customer data"
2. Show policies: "Simple JSON rules for access control"  
3. Run simulation: "See what each role would see"
4. Show actual redaction: "Data is masked based on policy"
5. Demo security: "Attempts to bypass are blocked"
6. Show integration: "One line to add to your code"

## The "Wow" Moment

The wow moment is when you show the same data being differently redacted for different agents:

```bash
# CEO sees everything
vault redact data.json policy.json -a ceo.json
> { "name": "John", "ssn": "123-45-6789", "salary": 150000 }

# Intern sees minimal
vault redact data.json policy.json -a intern.json  
> { "name": "John", "ssn": "[REDACTED]", "salary": "[REDACTED]" }
```

This makes the value proposition immediately clear!
